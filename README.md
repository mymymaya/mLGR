This file contains three main algorithms:
-- CGFI-GAN.py with a three-layer MLP model to reconstruct the original gene features
-- AGF-SMOTE.py to generate synthetic samples for a balanced dataset
-- mGLC.R for multi-label classification process and 10-fold cross validation based on different datasets and methods
